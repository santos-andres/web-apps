This is where all scripts are stored (python, R, jupyter notebooks, anatella files, etc.)

If there is a logical order to execute the scripts, 
make sure to put a prefix in the name with the order number: 
0_Load.anatella, 1_Clean.anatella, 2_upload_data.py etc.

Relevant and reusable python scripts should be integrated in src/
